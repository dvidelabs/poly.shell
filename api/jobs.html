<pre><code>var jobs = require('poly').jobs();
var sites = jobs.sites;</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>var sites = require('poly').sites();
var jobs = require('poly').jobs(sites);</code></pre>

<h2 id="jobs_Reference">jobs() Reference</h2>

<h3 id="jobs.add">jobs.add(jobname, [roles], [actions])</h3>

<p>Adds actions to a new or an existing named job. The job is not run, only
made available to the job schedulers <code>job.run</code> function.</p>

<p>If no role is given, the <code>jobname</code> is used as the role.</p>

<p>If no action is given, the job is made known but will not do anything. This
will silence errors about missing jobs. Actions can be added by calling
<code>jobs.add</code> again with the same name.</p>

<p><code>roles</code> : used to identify the sites that are allowed to run the job. When
the job is subsequently run, the job will either run on all sites, or on a
subset given by the restricting roles passed to the <code>job.run</code> function.</p>

<p>Roles cannot be added to existing actions, only restricted, when running.
However, sites may be added by including them in roles after a job has been
created, and new actions may be added in new roles. (This is unlike adding and
updating site configurations that effect immediately on sites in the given
roles.)</p>

<p>Example roles (arrays are flattened before use):</p>

<pre><code>"www"
["test", "deploy"]
["db", ["test", "deploy"], []]</code></pre>

<p><code>actions</code> : an optional function or (nested) array of functions that all run
in parallel on all sites that match the given role list.</p>

<p>An action is a function that does some work. By default it runs to completion
or starts or things that it does not wait for, but it can request a callback
function one or more times by calling the <code>this.async()</code> function. <code>this</code>
points to an action object with several other useful features including
<code>this.shell.run</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var email = require('my favorite email package');

jobs.add('upload-web', 'web', function() {
  cb = this.async();
  this.shell.run("scripts/deploy.sh", cb);
}
jobs.add('upload-web', 'web', function() {
  cb = this.async();
  this.shell.run("scripts/backup.sh", cb);
}
jobs.add('upgrade-web', 'web', function() {
  cb = this.async();
  this.shell.run("scripts/upgrade.sh", cb);
}
jobs.runSequential(['upload-web', 'upgrade-web'], 'web',
  { breakOnError: true },
  function(err) {
    if(err)
      email(this.site.adminemail, "admin alert", "the backups failed");
});</code></pre>

<p>In this admittedly contrived example, we could just have called the
above actions in single script, but by splitting it up, we can wait
for all web servers to complete their backups and site uploads before
switching over all servers to the new site version. By having backup
in a separate action we get better error reporting without risking not
running it along with the upgrade.</p>

<p>When a job is added multiple times, each action is associated with
those roles given when added to the job. In effect a job becomes a
cluster of actions that run together, but not necessarily in the same
place, but always at the same time.</p>

<p>When a job is run, each action will at most run once on each site,
even if the same site appear in multiple roles matching the same
action of the job. However, if the <code>jobname</code> is listed multiple times
in the array given to <code>jobs.run</code>, the job actions will run multiple
times on any matching site.</p>

<p>Actions within a single job always run in parallel, regardless of the
schedule used to run multiple jobs.</p>

<p>See also <code>Actions</code>.</p>

<h3 id="jobs.run">jobs.run(jobs, [roles], [options], [callback])</h3>

<p>Synonym for runSiteSequential.</p>

<p>The list of jobs being run is called a schedule.</p>

<p>The same job may appear multiple times in a schedule, and will then
execute multiple times.</p>

<p>When <code>jobs.run</code> is called, the schedule begins executing. The schedule
has completed when the callback is being called. This means that all
scheduled actions have of all jobs in the schedule have completed
(successfully or otherwise). Multiple schedules can be chained by
starting new schedules with <code>this.run</code> in the callback, or by using
one of the related run functions.</p>

<p>Chained schedules run in the same batch. <code>this.shared</code> provide access
to a batch global shared state in all action functions and all
schedule callbacks. <code>this.batchid</code> provides access to the globally
unique batch identifier. All actions and schedules have unique
identifiers prefixed by the batch identifier. The identifiers are used
extensively in logging, and are also useful for creating temporary
files.</p>

<p>Multiple actions within a single job always run in parallel.</p>

<p><code>jobs</code> : job name or (nested) array of job names. Jobs run in order at
each site, but in parallel across different sites.</p>

<p><code>roles</code> : optional name or (nested) array of role names. roles are
just to restrict the number of sites that will execute the schedule.
If a given job in the schedule matches the role ['www', 'db'], and
<code>roles</code> is set to 'db', then only sites in the <code>db</code> role will execute.
Some jobs in the schedule may not execute at all. Because all site
names are also rules, we can restrict a job to a single site in this
way.</p>

<p><code>callback</code> : called with null or error count once all jobs have
completed on all sites. complete is called with a schedule object as
this pointer giving access to various functionality. See <code>Schedules</code>
for more information about the schedule object given by the <code>this</code>
pointer in the callback.</p>

<p><code>options</code>:</p>

<ul><li><code>options.roles</code>: optional role filter to restrict number of affected sites.</li><li><code>options.name</code>: optional schedule name for logging.</li><li><code>options.desc</code> : optional schedule description for logging.</li><li><code>options.breakOnError</code>: if true terminate action sequence on a site that fails.</li><li><code>options.allowMissingJob</code>: if true allow missing jobs without throwing an exception.</li><li><code>options.report</code>: if true enable custom report output, even when <code>options.log</code> disabled.</li><li><code>options.debug</code>: if true enable custom debug output - independent of <code>options.log</code>.</li><li><code>options.quiet</code>: if true suppress error messages, overridden by <code>options.log</code>.</li></ul>

<h3 id="jobs.runSiteSequential">jobs.runSiteSequential(jobs, [roles], [options], [callback])</h3>

<p>Run job or jobs in a <code>site-sequential</code> schedule where one job
completes on a site before a new is started, but a new job can start
on one site before a previous job has finished on all other sites.
<code>callback</code> is called once all jobs have completed on all sites.</p>

<p><code>jobs.run</code> is a synonym for this function as this is normally the
desired behaviour.</p>

<p>See <code>jobs.run</code> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="jobs.runAtomic">jobs.runAtomic(jobs, [roles], [options], [callback])</h3>

<p>Runs a job on one site at a time. Starts a new job when that last
matching site has completed the current job. Job actions within a
single job on a single site run concurrently. <code>callback</code> is called
once all jobs have completed on all sites.</p>

<p>See <code>jobs.run</code> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="jobs.runSequential">jobs.runSequential(jobs, [roles], [options], [callback])</h3>

<p>Run jobs one after another in a <code>sequential</code> schedule such that a
single job runs concurrently on all matching sites, but also such that
no two jobs overlap across all sites. <code>callback</code> is called once all
jobs have completed on all sites.</p>

<p>See <code>jobs.run</code> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="jobs.runParallel">jobs.runParallel(jobs, [roles], [options], [callback])</h3>

<p>Runs all jobs in parallel on all sites. <code>callback</code> is called once all
job actions have completed.</p>

<p>See <code>jobs.run</code> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="jobs.sharePassword">jobs.sharePassword(roles, [password])</h3>

<p>Assigns a common password cache to all sites currently in the given
<code>roles</code>. Any sites added to a role subsequently will not automatically
be included. This is in line with how site configurations normally
work, but unlike how <code>jobs.add</code> use late binding of role names, so
watch out for that.</p>

<p>The optional <code>password</code> argument will set a password in the cache such
the the user is not prompted if the password match.</p>

<p><code>jobs.sharedPassword</code> can be called multiple times to have different
password agents for different sites. Any existing caches will be
replaced.</p>

<p>Many other scenarios are possible, but then password agents must be
created manually and stored manually in the <code>passwordCache</code> property
of relevant sites, possibly using a custom merge function for updating
site configurations. This is beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>
