## Use

* `poly.shell` to run shell commands on remote (and local systems)
transparently.
* `poly.shell.upload` and friends to easily migrate files between the local
system and a remote system.
* `poly.sites` to configure many systems at once, both for login and
for custom settings.
* `poly.jobs` to schedule multiple jobs that depend on each other but
run as much in parallel as possible.
* `poly.password` directly, or more likely, indirectly via `poly.jobs`
to manage shared password logins.
* `poly.envs` for generic role based configurations other than site
management.
