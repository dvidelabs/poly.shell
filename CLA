CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (CLA)

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in contributions, contributions are assumed
copy-left allowing the original LICENSE holder to do the following at will
without explicit permissions by contributing authors: to modify and include or
exclude contributions, change license of the project with contributions,
sub-license the project.

This CLA does not extend to branched projects to the extend branching is
permitted by the project LICENSE. That is, if the project is branched, any
changes to that branch is not considered contributions, but changes from any
such branch submitted back to the upstream project is considered contributions
unless otherwise explicitly stated.

Contributions should not be submitted if these terms are found disagreeable.
