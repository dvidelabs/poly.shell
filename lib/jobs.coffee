  # Adds actions to a new or existing named job.

  # If no role is given, the jobname is used as role.
  #
  # Roles are used to restrict the job to specific
  # sites that match these roles.
  # When the job is subsequently run, the job
  # may be further restricted to a subset of roles.
  #
  # Roles cannot be added, only restricted, when
  # running. However, sites may be added by including
  # them in roles after a job has been created.
  #
  # When a job is added multiple times, each action
  # is associated with those roles given when added
  # to the job. In effect a job becomes a cluster
  # of actions that run together, but not necessarily
  # in the same place, but always at the same time.
  #
  # Actions allways run concurrently, regardless of the
  # schedule used to run multiple jobs.
  #
  # example roles (arrays are flattened before use):
  #  "www"
  #  ["test", "deploy"]
  #  ["db", ["test", "deploy"]]
  #
  # A site is a name that maps to configurations settings
  # which typically include a host domain, a user,
  # and a local path. A site may be local (no host domain),
  # or remote. .ssh/config is typically used to map a host
  # to a real remote host with ssh keys.
  #
  # An action is a function that receives options and a
  # a callback. The callback must be called when the action
  # is considered complete wrt. error handling and dependent
  # actions, but the action may continue after that point.
  # It is, however, vital that the callback is called exactly
  # once.
