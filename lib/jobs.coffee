# Jobs require a sites collection to manage the configuration

  # add may be called multiple times with same name

  #
  # If no role is given, the jobname is used as role.
  #
  # A roles is a role name or an array of role names.
  # A role name represents a set of sites.
  # Roles may be updated so the set of sites a job
  # operates on, is not static.
  #
  # A site is a name that maps to configurations settings
  # which typically include a host domain, a user,
  # and a local path. A site may be local (no host domain),
  # or remote. .ssh/config is typically used to map a host
  # to a real remote host with ssh keys.
  #
  # An action is a function that receives options and a
  # a callback. The callback must be called when the action
  # is considered complete wrt. error handling and dependent
  # actions, but the action may continue after that point.
  # It is, however, vital that the callback is called exactly
  # once.
  # The options include configuration settings
  # and a shell that can execute local or remote shell
  # commands, depending on the location of the site.
  # A shell can coordinate password caching across actions
  # on same or multiple sites.
  #
  # A job is a set of concurrent actions associated with
  # a number of sites derived from the given roles.
  # Within a job, some actions may only execute on a subset
  # of all sites affected by the job.
  # Job execution may specify a role filter which restricts
  # the job to a subset of all sites supported.
