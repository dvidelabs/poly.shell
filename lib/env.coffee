  # Add new environent or update existing.
  #
  # `names` : env name or (nested) array of env names
  # `roles` : role name or (nested) array of role names
  #
  # An env implicitly becomes a member of the role with its own name.
  # An env has a reserved `name` property that cannot be overridden
  # (this is managed when the env is read).
  #
  # If a env already exists, the named settings replace existing properties at top level
  # and other top level properties remain untouched. Properties are not otherwise merged.
  # 
  # A new env is given its own name as role and optionally other specified role names.
  # an existing env is optionally added to new roles while keeping existing roles.
  #
  # This examples assume an env represents a site used for deployment,
  # but that is just one use case:
  #
  # examples :
  #
  #   sites = new Environment()
  #   sites.add(['host1', 'host2'], ['db', 'admin'], { path: '~/example', comment: "hosts defined in .ssh/config" });
  #   sites.add('test-host', { path: "/tmp", user: "test", host: "0.0.0.0" });
  #   sites.add('app.example.com');
