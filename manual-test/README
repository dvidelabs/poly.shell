These tests are manual and sort of adhoc to automate running
various shell scenarios on local and remote hosts.

Some cases include waiting for user password input.

Setup example.com to some useful server in .ssh/config.

Try using different hosts for example.com:
For example, Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu 10.04 behaves differently
with respect to sudo password timeouts.

Tests are generally run within this folder like:

  coffee local.coffee
  coffee remote.coffee
  ...
