These tests are manual and sort of adhoc to automate running
various shell scenarios on local and remote hosts.

Some cases include waiting for user password input.

Generally, .ssh/config should be configured with example.com host
and preferably tests should be run on different hosts.
For example, Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu 10.04 behaves differently
with respect to sudo password timeouts.

tests are generally run like:

  $ coffee test/manual/local.coffee

etc.
